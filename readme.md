# Advent of Code Solutions Repository README

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. The structure is organized to allow easy navigation and execution of solutions for each day of the challenge.

## Repository Structure
- **include/**: Contains header files.
  - `common.h`
  - `execute_day.h`
  - `solution.h`
- **input/**: Input files for each day's challenge.
  - `input_day1.txt`, `input_day2.txt`, ..., `input_day8.txt`
- **src/**: Solution files for each day.
  - `solution1.cpp`, ..., `solution9.cpp`
- `main.cpp`: Main program file.
- `makefile`: Makefile for building and running the solutions.

## Building and Running Solutions
The makefile included in this repository is used to compile and run the solutions. The available targets are:

- **all**: Run the solution for the current day.
- **all_solutions**: Run all solutions.
- **solved_solutions**: Run only the solutions that have been solved.
- **help**: Print a help message with usage instructions.

To build and run a target, use:
```bash
make [TARGET]
```

## Implementation Details
- The `main.cpp` file includes the solution headers and executes the solutions for each day.
- Solutions are templated and can time their execution.
- Conditional compilation flags are used to control the execution of specific days or sets of solutions.
- During december ```make``` will only run the solution to the current day. The rest of the year all soltuions will be ran.
